**Wellcome to the PBPath Journal Watch!** 

This bi-monthly journal watch features exciting recently published pancreas and biliary pathology articles that will provide up to date medical knowledge in our field. These articles will be showcased in several convenient categories, including surgical pathology, cytopathology, and molecular pathology among others. The articles in each category are in no particular order.  

Previous months’ issues may be found in our *[archive](http://pbpath.org/journal-watch-archive/)*.  

We encourage members to actively participate by recommending new articles and providing feedback using *[the forms provided](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeD3Z9J6Y7eMmiyM12f_SfAmHUlykb1zxZcwO6lg7cebGYQIQ/viewform)*.  

**We hope that you will enjoy the new PBPath Journal Watch!**

Congenital and hamartomatous lesions of the gastrointestinal tract cause diagnostic challenges for surgical pathologists. Many of these are merely histologic curiosities, whereas others have substantial clinical implications because they herald cancer syndromes or associated anomalies. Although a comprehensive discussion of all developmental abnormalities that can occur in the gastrointestinal tract is beyond the scope of a single manuscript, some entities are more likely to be encountered by surgical pathologists, have important clinical consequences, or pose diagnostic difficulties. The purpose of this review is to discuss the more common malformations and choristomas, as well as hamartomatous lesions that may be clinically important due to their risk for cancer development, frequent associations with heritable cancer syndromes and other anomalies, or potential to simulate other entities.

<div class='addthis_inline_share_toolbox' data-url='pbpath.org/journal-watch/' data-title='See this abstract on #PBPath #JournalWatch : AQP1 and AQP3 Expression are Associated With Severe Symptoms and Poor-prognosis of the Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma PMID: 30531392 '></div>

BACKGROUND: Approximately 80% of patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) have metastatic disease with poor prognosis, but clinically available biomarkers for the diagnosis, prediction of prognosis, and target therapy have not yet been identified.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression of aquaporin-1 (AQP1) and AQP3 protein and their clinicopathological significances in PDACs.
MATERIALS AND METHOD: AQP1 and AQP3 protein expression in 106 PDAC, 35 peritumoral tissues, 55 benign pancreatic lesions, and 13 normal pancreatic tissues was measured by immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: Western blot showed that AQP1 and AQP3 protein expression was significantly higher in PDAC tissues than that in benign pancreatic tissues (P<0.01). Immunohistochemistry showed that the percentages of positive AQP1 and AQP3 expressions were significantly higher in PDAC tumors than that in peritumoral tissues, benign, and normal pancreatic tissues (P<0.01). Benign pancreatic lesions with positive AQP1 and AQP3 expression exhibited a dysplasia or intraepithelial neoplasia. The percentage of cases with positive AQP1 and AQP3 expression was significantly lower in PDAC patients without lymph node metastasis and invasion, and having low Tumor, Node and Metastasis (TNM) stage disease than in patients with lymph node metastasis, invasion, and high TNM stage disease (P<0.05 or <0.01). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that positive AQP1 and AQP3 expression were significantly associated with survival in PDAC patients (P<0.001). Cox multivariate analysis revealed that positive AQP1 and AQP3 expression was independent poor prognosis factors in PDAC patients. The area under the curve of receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.669 for AQP1 and 0.707 for AQP3, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Positive AQP1 and AQP3 expressions are associated with the tumorigenesis and progression of PDAC. Both AQP1 and AQP3 are a diagnostic marker of PDAC and a predictive marker of poor prognosis in PDAC patients.

- **Clinicopathologic and prognostic significance of MKK4 and MKK7 in resectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma**
</summary> 

*Human pathology 2018 Dec;():*

PubMed: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=30537492

<div class='addthis_inline_share_toolbox' data-url='pbpath.org/journal-watch/' data-title='See this abstract on #PBPath #JournalWatch : Clinicopathologic and prognostic significance of MKK4 and MKK7 in resectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma PMID: 30537492 '></div>

Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4 (MKK4) and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 7 (MKK7) were shown to regulate biological behavior in many malignancies. In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), it remains controversial whether MKK4 and MKK7 have pro-oncogenic or tumor-suppressive activities. Furthermore, their clinicopathologic and prognostic implications are unknown. In the present study, we detected MKK4 and MKK7 expressions in the nucleus and cytoplasm of resected PDAC tissues from 321 patients by tissue microarray-based immunohistochemistry. Cytoplasmic MKK4 and MKK7 expressions were significantly down-regulated, while nuclear MKK4 expression was significantly up-regulated in tumor tissues compared with non-tumor tissues. Tumor cytoplasmic MKK4 and MKK7 expressions were significantly negatively associated with histological grade. Cytoplasmic MKK4 expression was also negatively correlated with CA19-9 level. By univariate analysis, high cytoplasmic MKK4 expression was significantly associated with longer cancer-specific survival (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.705; 95% confidence interval [95%CI]: 0.510-0.974), with a similar trend observed for MKK7 expression. High MKK4 and MKK7 mRNA expressions were significantly associated with longer overall survival in the TCGA database. Although MKK4 expression was not significant in a multivariate Cox regression analysis, combination of MKK4/MKK7 and pN stage was identified as an independent prognostic indicator and had the lowest HR (HR: 0.308; 95%CI: 0.126-0.752). Furthermore, combined analysis of MKK4 and MKK7 greatly increased the prognostic predictive power. In addition, down-regulation of MKK4 or MKK7 increased proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells in vitro. In conclusion, high MKK4 expression and its combination with high MKK7 expression both predicted favorable prognosis in resectable PDAC.

- **PD-L1 expression in pancreatic adenosquamous carcinoma: PD-L1 expression is limited to the squamous component**
</summary> 

*Pathology, research and practice 2018 Dec;214(12):2069-2074*

<div class='addthis_inline_share_toolbox' data-url='pbpath.org/journal-watch/' data-title='See this abstract on #PBPath #JournalWatch : PD-L1 expression in pancreatic adenosquamous carcinoma: PD-L1 expression is limited to the squamous component PMID: 30477643 '></div>

AIM: We examined the programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression in surgically resected pancreatic adenosquamous carcinoma (PASC) samples. Furthermore, the detection rate was also assessed using biopsy cases obtained from endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA).
METHODS: Fifteen cases of PASC (six resected and nine EUS-FNA biopsied) from the Kurume University Hospital between 2009 and 2016 were used for the evaluation of PD-L1 expression. As a control group, 34 cases of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDACs) were selected. To compare　the positivity and intensity of PD-L1, two types of clones (SP263, E1L3N) were examined for immunostaining. Only the membrane expression of PD-L1 was regarded as positive. The PD-L1 expressions in the squamous cell carcinoma component (SCc), adenocarcinoma component (ACc), and immune cells were assessed separately. The ratio of PD-L1 expression was calculated by counting the positive tumor cells, and tumor proportion score (TPS) was applied (TPS; Null < 1%, low expression; 1 ≤ TPS ≤ 49% and high expression; ≥ 50%).
RESULTS: PD-L1 expression was observed in five surgical PASC samples (83%). This shows that SCc presented a high expression in these cases. However, the overall TPS indicated a low expression. In contrast, only one case (3%) was positive for PD-L1 in PDACs, and the TPS indicated a low expression. No differences in PD-L1 expression were observed between the two clones, SP263 and E1L3N. High PD-L1 expression in the EUS-FNA sample was found in only one case (11%).
DISCUSSION: Although assessment using the tumor cells of PASC samples obtained from EUS-FNA was difficult, this study suggests the selective expression of PD-L1 in the SCc of PASC. Furthermore, it was considered that immune checkpoint inhibitors could provide therapeutic effects selectively on the SCc for the entire range of TPSs, though the PD-L1 expression was low.

</summary> 

*The American journal of pathology 2019 Jan;189(1):9-21*

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is one of the most aggressive malignant neoplasms with poor outcomes. At the time of diagnosis, the disease is usually at an advanced stage and only a minority is eligible for surgical resection. To improve the prognosis, it is essential to diagnose and treat the disease in an early stage before its progression into an invasive disease. This article reviews clinical features, histopathology, cytopathology, and molecular alterations of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and its precursors. Moreover, we review a recently updated two-tier classification system for precursor lesions, new findings in premalignant cystic neoplasms, and recently updated staging criteria for invasive carcinoma based on the Cancer Staging Manual, eighth edition, from the American Joint Committee on Cancer. Finally, we discuss the potential clinical applications of the rapidly growing molecular and genetic information of pancreatic cancer and its precursors.

- **Application of the Eighth Edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging for Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma**
</summary> 

*Pancreas 2018 07;47(6):742-747*

PubMed: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=29851752

<div class='addthis_inline_share_toolbox' data-url='pbpath.org/journal-watch/' data-title='See this abstract on #PBPath #JournalWatch : Application of the Eighth Edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging for Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma PMID: 29851752 '></div>

OBJECTIVES: Notable modifications have been made in the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Staging eighth edition staging for pancreatic cancer for the consideration of the irreproducible and inapplicable of the AJCC seventh edition staging. However, the new staging classification has not been systemically verified.
METHODS: A comparison was performed to evaluate the application of the AJCC seventh and eighth staging classifications using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registry (18,450 patients) and an institutional series (2040 patients).
RESULTS: For the eighth staging classification, patients with tumor diameter of greater than 4 cm (T3N0M0, IIA) had similar prognosis to patients with 1 to 3 positive nodes (T1-3N1M0, IIB). For patients who underwent tumor resection and without lymph node involvement, survival curves of T1 (≤2 cm), T2 (2-4 cm), and T3 (>4 cm) were well separated. Statistical difference in survival analyses was demonstrated in N0 (0 positive node), N1 (1-3 positive nodes), and N2 (≥4 positive nodes) patients underwent tumor resection. The AJCC eighth edition had better stage distribution than the AJCC seventh edition for pancreatic cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: The eighth edition of AJCC staging is more applicable and accurate than the seventh edition for pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

</summary> 

*Journal of surgical oncology 2018 Dec;118(8):1277-1284*

PubMed: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=30380143

<div class='addthis_inline_share_toolbox' data-url='pbpath.org/journal-watch/' data-title='See this abstract on #PBPath #JournalWatch : Incidence and risk factors for abdominal occult metastatic disease in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma PMID: 30380143 '></div>

BACKGROUND: The incidence of occult metastatic disease (OMD) in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and associated risk factors are largely unknown.
METHODS: We identified all patients with PDAC, who had an aborted oncologic operation due to OMD within a 10-year period. The cases were matched to a cohort of resected PDAC patients on a 1:3 ratio, based on age and sex, for comparison of preoperative clinical characteristics and potential risk factors for OMD.
RESULTS: In the studied period, 117 patients with OMD were identified in 1423 pancreatectomies performed for PDAC (8%). Liver metastases were the most common finding (79%) followed by peritoneal implants (16%). When compared with non-OMD cases, patients with OMD presented more often with abdominal pain (P < 0.001), and higher preoperative carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) values ( P = 0.007). Additionally, indeterminate liver lesions on preoperative computed tomography (CT) were identified in 40% of OMD versus 17% of non-OMD patients ( P < 0.001). Multivariable analysis distinguished four independent predictors for OMD: indeterminate lesions on preoperative CT, tumor size > 30 mm, abdominal pain, and preoperative CA 19-9 > 192 U/mL.
CONCLUSIONS: Occurrence of OMD in PDAC accounts for 8% of cases. Preoperative CA 19-9 > 192 U/mL, primary tumor size > 30 mm, and identification of indeterminate lesions in preoperative CT may indicate the need for diagnostic laparoscopy.

<div class='addthis_inline_share_toolbox' data-url='pbpath.org/journal-watch/' data-title='See this abstract on #PBPath #JournalWatch : New Model for Predicting Malignancy in Patients With Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasm PMID: 30499803 '></div>

OBJECTIVE: To create a simple, objective model to predict the presence of malignancy in patients with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN), which can be easily applied in daily practice and, importantly, adopted for any lesion types.
BACKGROUND: No predictive model for malignant IPMN has been widely applied in clinical practice.
METHODS: The clinical details of 466 patients with IPMN who underwent pancreatic resection at 3 hospitals were retrospectively analyzed for model development. Then, the model was validated in 664 surgically resected patients at 8 hospitals in Japan.In the preoperative examination, endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) was considered to be essential to observe mural nodules in both the model development and external validation sets. Malignant IPMNs were defined as those with high-grade dysplasia and associated invasive carcinoma.
RESULTS: Of the 466 patients, 258 (55%) had malignant IPMNs (158 high-grade dysplasia, 100 invasive carcinoma), and 208 (45%) had benign IPMNs. Logistic regression analysis resulted in 3 variables (mural nodule size, main pancreatic duct diameter, and cyst size) being selected to construct the model. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the model was 0.763. In external validation sets, the pathological diagnosis was malignant and benign IPMN in 351 (53%) and 313 (47%) cases, respectively. For the external validation, the malignancy prediction ability of the model corresponded to an AUC of 0.725.
CONCLUSION: This predictive model provides important information for physicians and patients in assessing an individual's risk for malignancy and may help to identify patients who need surgery.

<div class='addthis_inline_share_toolbox' data-url='pbpath.org/journal-watch/' data-title='See this abstract on #PBPath #JournalWatch : Pseudomyxoma Peritonei After a Total Pancreatectomy for Intraductal Papillary Mucinous Neoplasm With Colloid Carcinoma in Lynch Syndrome PMID: 30531244 '></div>

We report a case of pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP) arising in a 62-year-old male patient with Lynch syndrome (LS). The patient's medical history included an adenocarcinoma of the colon for which a right hemicolectomy was performed and a pancreatectomy due to an intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) with invasive colloid carcinoma. It was considered that the PMP could be a metastasis of the earlier colonic or pancreatic carcinoma. The pancreatic carcinoma, colon carcinoma, and PMP tissues were examined, and immunohistochemical and molecular analyses were performed to determine the PMP origin. Histopathologic examination revealed morphological similarities with the pancreatic colloid carcinoma, and further immunohistochemical and molecular analyses, including a shared GNAS mutation, confirmed the pancreatic origin of the PMP. In conclusion, this is a unique case of a patient with LS presenting with PMP originating from an IPMN with invasive colloid carcinoma, several years after pancreatectomy. The present case has important diagnostic implications. The IPMN should be considered as a rare extracolonic manifestation of LS, and pancreatic carcinoma origin should be considered in patients presenting with PMP. This case report highlights the added value of molecular diagnostics in daily pathology practice.

Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) are precursor lesions of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Current edition of WHO Classification of Tumors of the Digestive System recognizes four different subtypes (gastric, intestinal, pancreatobiliary, and oncocytic) and recommends analysis of mucin expression (MUC1, MUC2, MUC5AC, MUC6) as well as evaluation of architectural and cell differentiation patterns for correct classification. However, there is no consensus on MUC1 expression of IPMN-lesions in the literature. Current recommendations are based on studies where antibodies against the core MUC1 protein or sialylated MUC1 (tumor associated MUC1), not the fully glycosylated MUC1 were used. We have recently reported that MUC1 is strongly expressed in both gastric and intestinal types IPMN specimens from the cystic wall, obtained by endoscopic ultrasound guided microbiopsy procedure. We have used a commercial MUC1 antibody, validated and recommended for diagnostic use, which recognizes fully glycosylated MUC1. Based on the above, we propose a revision of the WHO Classification, specifying that antibodies against tumor associated MUC1 should be used for IPMN subtyping.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is increasing in incidence and is projected to become the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Despite significant advances in understanding the disease, there has been minimal increase in PDAC patient survival. PDAC tumors are unique in the fact that there is significant desmoplasia. This generates a large stromal compartment composed of immune cells, inflammatory cells, growth factors, extracellular matrix, and fibroblasts, comprising the tumor microenvironment (TME), which may represent anywhere from 15% to 85% of the tumor. It has become evident that the TME, including both the stroma and extracellular component, plays an important role in tumor progression and chemoresistance of PDAC. This review will discuss the multiple components of the TME, their specific impact on tumorigenesis, and the multiple therapeutic targets.

- **Immune Cell and Stromal Signature Associated With Progression-Free Survival of Patients With Resected Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma**

<div class='addthis_inline_share_toolbox' data-url='pbpath.org/journal-watch/' data-title='See this abstract on #PBPath #JournalWatch : Immune Cell and Stromal Signature Associated With Progression-Free Survival of Patients With Resected Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma PMID: 30092175 '></div>

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Changes to the microenvironment of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDACs) have been associated with poor outcomes of patients. We studied the associations between composition of the pancreatic stroma (fibrogenic, inert, dormant, or fibrolytic stroma) and infiltration by inflammatory cells and times of progression-free survival (PFS) of patients with PDACs after resection.
METHODS: We obtained 1824 tissue microarray specimens from 385 patients included in the European Study Group for Pancreatic Cancer trial 1 and 3 and performed immunohistochemistry to detect alpha smooth muscle actin, type 1 collagen, CD3, CD4, CD8, CD68, CD206, and neutrophils. Tumors that expressed high and low levels of these markers were compared with patient outcomes using Kaplan-Meier curves and multivariable recursive partitioning for discrete-time survival tree analysis. Prognostic index was delineated by a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model of immune cell and stromal markers and PFS. Findings were validated using 279 tissue microarray specimens from 93 patients in a separate cohort.
RESULTS: Levels of CD3, CD4, CD8, CD68, and CD206 were independently associated with tumor recurrence. Recursive partitioning for discrete-time survival tree analysis identified a high level of CD3 as the strongest independent predictor for longer PFS. Tumors with levels of CD3 and high levels of CD206 associated with a median PFS time of 16.6 months and a median prognostic index of -0.32 (95% confidence interval [CI] -0.35 to -0.31), whereas tumors with low level of CD3 cell and low level of CD8 and high level of CD68 associated with a median PFS time of 7.9 months and a prognostic index of 0.32 (95% CI 0.050-0.32); we called these patterns histologic signatures. Stroma composition, when unassociated with inflammatory cell markers, did not associate significantly with PFS. In the validation cohort, the histologic signature resulted in an error matrix accuracy of predicted response of 0.75 (95% CI 0.64-0.83; accuracy P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: In an analysis of PDAC tissue microarray specimens, we identified and validated a histologic signature, based on leukocyte and stromal factors, that associates with PFS times of patients with resected PDACs. Immune cells might affect the composition of the pancreatic stroma to affect progression of PDAC. These findings provide new insights into the immune response to PDAC.

Pancreatic cancer is characterized by an extensive fibroinflammatory reaction that includes immune cells, fibroblasts, extracellular matrix, vascular and lymphatic vessels, and nerves. Overwhelming evidence indicates that the pancreatic cancer microenvironment regulates cancer initiation, progression, and maintenance. Pancreatic cancer treatment has progressed little over the past several decades, and the prognosis remains one of the worst for any cancer. The contribution of the microenvironment to carcinogenesis is a key area of research, offering new potential targets for treating the disease. Here, we explore the composition of the pancreatic cancer stroma, discuss the network of interactions between different components, and describe recent attempts to target the stroma therapeutically. We also discuss current areas of active research related to the tumor microenvironment. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Physiology Volume 81 is February 10, 2019. Please see http://www.annualreviews.org/page/journal/pubdates for revised estimates.

<div class='addthis_inline_share_toolbox' data-url='pbpath.org/journal-watch/' data-title='See this abstract on #PBPath #JournalWatch : Stratification of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinomas Based on Tumor and Microenvironment Features PMID: 30165049 '></div>

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Genomic studies have revealed subtypes of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) based on their molecular features, but different studies have reported different classification systems. It is a challenge to obtain high-quality, freshly frozen tissue for clinical analysis and determination of PDA subtypes. We aimed to redefine subtypes of PDA using a large number of formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded PDA samples, which are more amenable to routine clinical evaluation.
METHODS: We collected PDA samples from 309 consecutive patients who underwent surgery from September 1996 through December 2010 at 4 academic hospitals in Europe; nontumor tissue samples were not included. Samples were formalin fixed and paraffin embedded. DNA and RNA were isolated; gene expression, targeted DNA sequencing, and immunohistochemical analyses were performed. We used independent component analysis to deconvolute normal, tumor, and microenvironment transcriptome patterns in samples. We devised classification systems from an unsupervised analysis using a consensus clustering approach of our data set after removing normal contamination components. We associated subtypes with overall survival and disease-free survival of patients using Cox proportional hazards regression with estimation of hazard ratios and 95% confidence interval. We used The Cancer Genome Consortium and International Cancer Genome Consortium PDA data sets as validation cohorts.
RESULTS: We validated the previously reported basal-like and classical tumor-specific subtypes of PDAs. We identified features of the PDA, including microenvironment gene expression patterns, that allowed tumors to be categorized into 5 subtypes, called pure basal like, stroma activated, desmoplastic, pure classical, and immune classical. These PDA subtypes have features of cancer cells and immune cells that could be targeted by pharmacologic agents. Tumor subtypes were associated with patient outcomes, based on analysis of our data set and the International Cancer Genome Consortium and The Cancer Genome Consortium PDA data sets. We also observed an exocrine signal associated with acinar cell contamination (from pancreatic tissue).
CONCLUSIONS: We identified a classification system based on gene expression analysis of formalin-fixed PDA samples. We identified 5 PDA subtypes, based on features of cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment. This system might be used to select therapies and predict patient outcomes. We found evidence that the previously reported exocrine-like (called ADEX) tumor subtype resulted from contamination with pancreatic acinar cells. ArrayExpress accession number: E-MTAB-6134.

- **Pancreatic Acinar Metaplasia in Distal Esophageal Biopsies Is Associated With Chronic Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drug Use**
</summary> 

*Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine 2018 Dec;():*

<div class='addthis_inline_share_toolbox' data-url='pbpath.org/journal-watch/' data-title='See this abstract on #PBPath #JournalWatch : Pancreatic Acinar Metaplasia in Distal Esophageal Biopsies Is Associated With Chronic Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drug Use PMID: 30525934 '></div>

CONTEXT.—: The cause of pancreatic acinar metaplasia (PAM) at the distal esophagus/esophagogastric junction is still controversial. Whereas some authors believe it is congenital, others believe it is acquired because of inflammation of the gastric cardia, and more recently it was proposed to be due to chronic proton pump inhibitor use based on a study in rats.
OBJECTIVE.—: To determine whether there is correlation between chronic proton pump inhibitor use and PAM in humans. We also investigated the correlation between several clinical and pathologic factors and PAM.
DESIGN.—: Four hundred forty-four consecutive biopsies from the distal esophagus/esophagogastric junction were reviewed for the presence of PAM, which was then correlated with several clinical and pathologic findings.
RESULTS.—: Pancreatic acinar metaplasia was found in 71 patients (16%). Pancreatic acinar metaplasia was significantly associated with patient age younger than 51 years ( P < .001), chronic carditis ( P = .01), and chronic proton pump inhibitor use ( P = .008). Surprisingly, we also found significant association between PAM and chronic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use ( P < .001). These associations, including that with chronic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use, remained significant in multivariate analysis.
CONCLUSIONS.—: Our findings confirm the previous reports of significant association between PAM and chronic carditis and the findings from animal studies of association with chronic proton pump inhibitor use. The strong association with chronic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use has not been previously reported and warrants further studies.

- **Tumefactive Inflammatory Diseases of the Pancreas**
</summary> 

*The American journal of pathology 2019 Jan;189(1):82-93*

PubMed: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=30558726

<div class='addthis_inline_share_toolbox' data-url='pbpath.org/journal-watch/' data-title='See this abstract on #PBPath #JournalWatch : Tumefactive Inflammatory Diseases of the Pancreas PMID: 30558726 '></div>

Advances in the past two decades have resulted in the recognition of several tumefactive pancreatic lesions that, on histologic evaluation, show a varying combination of inflammation and fibrosis. Autoimmune pancreatitis, the prototypic tumefactive pancreatic fibroinflammatory lesion, is composed of two distinct diseases, type 1 autoimmune pancreatitis and the less common type 2 autoimmune pancreatitis. Although designated as autoimmune pancreatitis, the two diseases show little morphologic or pathogenic overlap. In type 1 disease, subsets of T lymphocytes (type 2 helper T cells, regulatory T cells, and T follicular helper 2 cells) are hypothesized to drive the inflammatory reaction. The B-cell response is characterized by an oligoclonal expansion of plasmablasts, with dominant clones that vary among patients and distinct clones that emerge at the time of relapse. Although the precise role of IgG4 in this condition remains uncertain, recent studies suggest that other IgG subclasses (eg, IgG1) may mediate the immune reactions, whereas IgG4 represents a response to dampen excessive inflammation. A recent study of type 2 autoimmune pancreatitis highlights the role of CXCL8 (alias IL-8), with duct epithelium and infiltrating T lymphocytes expressing this chemokine; the latter may contribute to the distinct form of neutrophilic inflammation in this disease. The review also highlights other forms of mass-forming chronic pancreatitis: follicular pancreatitis, groove pancreatitis, and those associated with rheumatologic diseases.

<div class='addthis_inline_share_toolbox' data-url='pbpath.org/journal-watch/' data-title='See this abstract on #PBPath #JournalWatch : Clinicopathological and immunological features of follicular pancreatitis-a distinct disease entity characterized by Th17 activation PMID: 30515871 '></div>

AIM: Follicular pancreatitis is a recently recognized, distinct clinicopathological entity characterized by the presence of many intrapancreatic lymphoid follicles with reactive germinal centres. However, the clinicopathological and immunological features and causes have not yet been established. We assessed the clinicopathological and immunological profiles of patients with follicular pancreatitis who underwent surgery.
METHODS AND RESULTS: This study included three patients with pancreatic masses (age range: 62-75 years; women:men: 1:2). A histopathological study of the resected pancreatic masses revealed abundant lymphoid follicles with reactive germinal centres in both periductal regions and diffusely within the parenchyma. No storiform fibrosis, obliterative phlebitis, or granulocytic epithelial lesions were observed. The immunohistochemical examination revealed an IgG4/IgG-positive plasma cell ratio <30% in all patients. Podoplanin (Th17 marker)-expressing lymphocytes were present in the lymphoid follicles of those with follicular pancreatitis, whereas these were absent in normal lymph nodes and in lymphoid follicles of those with IgG4-related autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP). An RNA digital counting assay clearly demonstrated that the expression counts of 20 genes, including dendritic cells and lymphoid follicles markers, and related cytokines were significantly higher in follicular pancreatitis than in IgG4-related AIP (p<0.01). The expressions of CCR6 and IL23A, which are genes related to Th17, were high.
CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that follicular pancreatitis is a histopathologically and immunologically distinct disease entity of pancreatitis and is characterized by upregulated Th17 expression. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

Cholangiolocellular carcinoma (CLC) is a unique subtype of primary liver carcinoma, which sometimes coexists with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), cholangiocarcinoma and combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma (cHCC-CCA). "Ductal plate malformation" (DPM)-pattern of primary liver carcinoma, which resembles biliary lesions in Caroli disease and von Meyenburg complex, is sometimes associated with CLC. We examined genetic alterations of hTERT promoter (hTERT), IDH1 or 2 (IDH1/2), KRAS, ARID1A, PBRM1, ARID2, BAP1, p53 and their association with histologic features such as proportion of CLC and DPM-pattern in 77 patients with primary liver carcinoma diagnosed as cHCC-CCA or CLC. Primary liver carcinomas were histologically subdivided into 29 CLC-predominant (CLC component >80%), 31 with CLC (5% to 80%) and 17 without CLC (<5%). CLC-predominant group was characterized by older age, male-predominant and smaller tumor size. Genetic alterations were detected in hTERT (25%), ARID1A (21%), PBRM1 (20%), ARID2 (3%), BAP1 (1%), p53 (46%), KRAS (5%), and IDH1/2 (8%). ARID1A alteration was more frequent in CLC-predominant group, compared with other groups (P<0.05) and was correlated with the degree of DPM-pattern (P<0.01). Alterations of hTERT and p53 were less frequent in CLC-predominant group compared with "with CLC group" (P<0.05). hTERT mutation was less frequent in carcinomas with DPM-pattern (P<0.01). PBRM1 alteration was more frequent in CLC with focal HCC subgroup and without CLC group compared with other groups (P<0.05). CLC may be a distinct subgroup of primary liver carcinoma, which is different from cHCC-CCA, based on clinicopathologic and genetic alterations. ARID1A alterations may characterize CLC with DPM-pattern and could be a diagnostic immunohistochemical marker for small CLCs with DPM-pattern.

<div class='addthis_inline_share_toolbox' data-url='pbpath.org/journal-watch/' data-title='See this abstract on #PBPath #JournalWatch : Data set for the reporting of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, perihilar cholangiocarcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma: recommendations from the International Collaboration on Cancer Reporting (ICCR) PMID: 29573451 '></div>

Optimal patient management benefits from comprehensive and accurate pathology reports that contribute to cancer staging and prognostication. Proforma reports are used in many countries, but these vary in their structure and implementation. The International Collaboration on Cancer Reporting (ICCR) is an alliance formed by the Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia, the Royal College of Pathologists of the United Kingdom, the College of American Pathologists, the Canadian Partnership Against Cancer the European Society of Pathology and the American Society of Clinical Pathology (ASCP), with the aim of developing an evidence-based reporting data set for each cancer site. It is argued that this should reduce the global burden of cancer data set development and reduplication of effort by different international institutions that commission, publish and maintain standardised cancer reporting data sets. The resultant standardisation of cancer reporting will benefit not only those countries directly involved in the collaboration but also others not in a position to develop their own data sets. We describe the development of a cancer data set by the ICCR expert panel for the reporting of the main malignant liver tumours: intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, perihilar cholangiocarcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma and present the 'required' and 'recommended' elements to be included in the report with an explanatory commentary. This data set incorporates definitions and classifications in the most recent World Health Organisation (WHO) publication on hepatic malignancies (4th edition) and the recently published tumour-node-metastasis (TNM)8 staging system. Widespread adoption and implementation of this data set will enable consistent and accurate data collection, comparison of epidemiological and pathological parameters between different populations, facilitate research and ultimately result in better patient outcomes.

<div class='addthis_inline_share_toolbox' data-url='pbpath.org/journal-watch/' data-title='See this abstract on #PBPath #JournalWatch : EBV as a potential risk factor for hepatobiliary system cancer: A meta-analysis with 918 cases PMID: 30497878 '></div>

OBJECTIVES: Hepatobiliary system cancer, which includes hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), cholangiocarcinoma, and gallbladder carcinoma, has an increase of incidence and mortality due to various risk factors. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is associated with various types of lymphomas and carcinomas, which is also acknowledged as the first-discovered human tumor virus. Despite this, there is no systematic analysis about the relationship between the infection of EBV and hepatobiliary system cancer. The aim of this meta-analysis is to explore the significance of EBV infection in the development of hepatobiliary system cancer by evaluating the EBV infection ratio.
METHODS: A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, as well as China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Chongqing VIP, Wan Fang, and China Biology Medicine databases was conducted. The EBV infection ratio and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) in hepatobiliary system cancer was evaluated. The I2 statistic was used to represent heterogeneity. Through meta-regression, stratified analyses were applied to find out heterogeneity's sources. Odds ratios (ORs), 95% CIs of EBV infection in case-control studies were calculated.
RESULTS: Altogether, 15 studies were included containing a total of 918 cases and 157 controls. The whole infection ratio of EBV was 23% (95% CI: 13%, 33%, I2 = 95.7%, P < 0.001) among all the patients. Comparable EVB infection ratios were observed in hepatobiliary system cancer as divided into different subtypes. The five case-control studies were epitomized to a pooled OR of 9.35 (95%CI: 2.95, 29.61, I2 = 20.1%, P < 0.286).
CONCLUSION: EBV may be a potentially risk factor in the process of hepatobiliary system cancer. The prospective molecular mechanism remains to be explored.

<div class='addthis_inline_share_toolbox' data-url='pbpath.org/journal-watch/' data-title='See this abstract on #PBPath #JournalWatch : Current survival and treatment trends for surgically resected intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma in the United States PMID: 30505597 '></div>

Background: Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is a rare and aggressive disease with an increasing incidence in the United States, and there is no level 1 evidence to help guide treatment decisions. We sought to determine national trends in surgical and medical management of patients with resected ICC, and more specifically, the role of lymphadenectomy (LAD) and utilization of chemotherapy.
Methods: An augmented version of the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) cancer database registry was used to identify all surgically resected ICC patients from 2000 to 2014. We evaluated the incidence and adequacy of LAD, and receipt of chemotherapy over time. Next, multivariable logistic regressions were performed to determine the predictors of LAD and receipt of chemotherapy. Overall survival (OS) was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazard models.
Results: We identified 1,263 patients who underwent resection for ICC. Lymph nodes (LNs) were removed in 49% of patients, however, only 10% of patients received adequate LAD by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) criteria (≥6 nodes). LN metastases were found in 29% of patients who underwent nodal evaluation. Chemotherapy was administered to 40% of patients, was utilized more frequently over time (P<0.05), and was associated with improved survival in node positive patients (P<0.05). Patients who did not have LNs evaluated were significantly less likely to receive chemotherapy than those who did. Lastly, OS for the entire cohort improved over time (P<0.05).
Conclusions: After analyzing the treatment and outcomes of resectable ICC, we concluded: (I) LN evaluation at the time of surgical resection remains inadequate; (II) utilization of chemotherapy has increased over time; (III) the lack of LAD likely results in under-staging and underutilization of chemotherapy; and (IV) despite less than ideal surgical and medical therapy median OS continues to improve.

- **Actual 5-Year Survivors After Surgical Resection of Hilar Cholangiocarcinoma**

<div class='addthis_inline_share_toolbox' data-url='pbpath.org/journal-watch/' data-title='See this abstract on #PBPath #JournalWatch : Actual 5-Year Survivors After Surgical Resection of Hilar Cholangiocarcinoma PMID: 30539494 '></div>

BACKGROUND: The prevalence and characteristics of actual 5-year survivors after surgical treatment of hilar cholangiocarcinoma (HC) have not been described previously.
METHODS: Patients who underwent resection for HC from 2000 to 2015 were analyzed through a multi-institutional registry from 10 U.S. academic medical centers. The clinicopathologic characteristics and both the perioperative and long-term outcomes for actual 5-year survivors were compared with those for non-survivors (patients who died within 5 years after surgery). Patients alive at last encounter who had a follow-up period shorter than 5 years were excluded from the study.
RESULTS: The study identified 257 patients with HC who underwent curative-intent resection with an actuarial 5-year survival of 19%. Of 194 patients with a follow-up period longer than 5 years, 23 (12%) were 5-year survivors. Compared with non-survivors, the 5-year survivors had a lower median pretreatment CA 19-9 level (116 vs. 34 U/L; P = 0.008) and a lower rate of lymph node involvement (42% vs. 15%; P = 0.027) and R1 margins (39% vs. 17%; P = 0.042). However, the sole presence of these factors did not preclude a 5-year survival after surgery. The frequencies of bile duct resection alone, major hepatectomy, caudate lobe resection, portal vein or hepatic artery resection, preoperative biliary sepsis, intraoperative blood transfusion, serious postoperative complications, and receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy were comparable between the two groups.
CONCLUSIONS: One in eight patients with HC reaches the 5-year survival milestone after resection. A 5-year survival can be achieved even in the presence of traditionally unfavorable clinicopathologic factors (elevated CA 19-9, nodal metastasis, and R1 margins).

BACKGROUND: Microvascular invasion (MiVI) is a histological feature of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) that may be associated with biological behavior. We sought to investigate the impact of MiVI on long-term survival of patients undergoing curative-intent resection for ICC.
METHODS: A total of 1089 patients undergoing curative-intent resection for ICC were identified. Data on clinicopathological characteristics, disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS) were compared among patients with no vascular invasion (NoVI), MiVI, and macrovascular invasion (MaVI).
RESULTS: A total of 249 (22.9%) patients had MiVI, while 149 (13.7%) patients had MaVI (±MiVI). MiVI was associated with higher incidence of perineural, biliary and adjacent organ invasion, and satellite lesions (all P < 0.01). On multivariable analysis, MiVI was an independent risk factor of DFS (hazard ratios [HR] 1.5; 95%confidence intervals [CI], 1.3-1.9; P < 0.001), but not OS (HR 1.1; 95%CI, 0.9-1.3; P = 0.379). While MiVI and MaVI patients had similar DFS (median, MiVI 14.0 vs MaVI 12.0 months, HR 0.9; 95%CI, 0.7-1.2; P = 0.377), OS was better among MiVI patients (median, MiVI 39.0 vs MaVI 21.0 months, HR 0.7; 95%CI, 0.5-0.8; P = 0.002). Whereas nodal metastasis, R1 margin, and postoperative morbidity were associated with early death (≤18 months) among patients with MiVI, only nodal metastasis was associated with late (>18 months) prognosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Roughly 1 out of 5 patients with resected ICC had MiVI. MiVI was associated with advanced tumor characteristics and a higher risk of tumor recurrence.

<div class='addthis_inline_share_toolbox' data-url='pbpath.org/journal-watch/' data-title='See this abstract on #PBPath #JournalWatch : Importance of routine histopathological examination of a gallbladder surgical specimen: Unexpected gallbladder cancer PMID: 30488851 '></div>

Introduction: Cholecystectomy performed for benign diseases of the gallbladder is important for the diagnosis of gallbladder cancer. This is done by pathological examination of the removed specimens for patients with no detected or suspected complications before surgery. Although some centers undertake selective approaches for histopathological examination of gallbladder specimens, many centers perform this examination routinely. In our study, we investigated results of pathological examinations carried out on cholecystectomy specimens, in respect to unexpected cases of gallbladder cancer.
Methods: We reviewed cholecystectomy cases performed for benign diseases of gallbladder from January 2012 to February 2016 by investigating pathological specimens from the gallbladder. We evaluated demographical properties and their association with the pathological diagnosis and frequency of unexpected gallbladder cancer cases. We reported additional treatment and survival information of the malignancy cases after surgery.
Results: We reviewed 1294 cases of cholecystectomy, and the mean patient age was 47.5 ± 14.3 years. The most frequent diagnosis was chronic cholecystitis (92.3%), and it was more prevalent among younger patients and female sex (P < 0.0001). Five patients (0.4%) were determined to have gallbladder cancer, and the mean age of these cases was 65.6 ± 18.2 years. Two cases were Stage 2, two cases were Stage 3B, and one case was Stage 3A. There was no T1 or Tis tumor.
Conclusion: Routine histopathological examination of gallbladder is significant with respect to the determination of additional interventions at the postoperative period required for cancer cases coincidentally diagnosed.

<div class='addthis_inline_share_toolbox' data-url='pbpath.org/journal-watch/' data-title='See this abstract on #PBPath #JournalWatch : Patterns of Presentation, Treatment, and Survival Rates of Gallbladder Cancer: a Prospective Study at a Tertiary Care Centre PMID: 28367607 '></div>

BACKGROUND: India has high incidence of gallbladder carcinoma with regional variation in incidence, the highest in Northern India. This study examines the patterns of presentation, treatment strategies, and survival rate of all patients with gallbladder cancer (GBC) evaluated at our tertiary academic hospital over a period of 2 years.
METHODS: All patients presented to our institute with established tissue diagnosis of carcinoma gallbladder were accrued in our study over a time period of 2 years. Presentation, treatment modalities, and survival rates were analyzed.
RESULTS: One hundred six patients were included: 80 females and 26 males (F: M = 3:1). Median age was 60 years. Eighty patients (75%) had gallstones and 20 patients (21%) had typical history of chronic cholecystitis. The common symptom and sign at presentation were pain in the right upper abdomen (81%) and lump abdomen (49%), respectively. Overall resectability rate was 19.8% (21/106). Eighty-five patients were unresectable or metastatic and treated with palliative intent. Stagewise distribution at diagnosis was stage I (0%), stage II (4%), stage IIIA (10%), stage IIIB (8%), stage IVA (17%), and stage IVB (61%). Estimated 1-year survival for stages II, IIIA, IIIB, IVA, and IVB was 100, 76, 47.4, 26, and 10.6%, respectively. Significant difference in OS was observed among different stages of GBC (p value <0.001).
CONCLUSION: If proper investigations are done, radical surgery including multi-organ resection can be curative with acceptable morbidity and mortality. Stage at presentation and ability to perform curative resection are the most important prognostic factors predicting survival. Palliative chemotherapy should be considered for metastatic GBC.

- **National Failure of Surgical Staging for T1b Gallbladder Cancer**

<div class='addthis_inline_share_toolbox' data-url='pbpath.org/journal-watch/' data-title='See this abstract on #PBPath #JournalWatch : National Failure of Surgical Staging for T1b Gallbladder Cancer PMID: 30499077 '></div>

BACKGROUND: Current guidelines recommend radical cholecystectomy with regional lymphadenectomy (RC-RL) for patients with T1b gallbladder cancer (GBC). However, the extent to which these guidelines are followed is unclear. This study aimed to evaluate current surgical practices for T1b GBC and their implications for overall management strategies and associated outcomes.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study investigated patients identified from the National Cancer Data Base (2004-2012) with non-metastatic T1b GBC. The patients were categorized according to type of surgical treatment received: simple cholecystectomy (SC) or RC-RL. Among the patients who had lymph nodes pathologically examined, nodal status was classified as pN- or pN+. Use of any adjuvant therapy was ascertained. Overall survival (OS) was compared based on type of surgical treatment and nodal status.
RESULTS: The cohort comprised 464 patients (247 SC and 217 RC-RL cases). The positive margin status did not differ between the two groups (6.1% for SC vs 2.3% for RC-RL; p = 0.128). For RC-RL, the pN+ rate was 15%. Adjuvant therapies were used more frequently in pN+ (53.1% vs 9.4% for pN-). By comparison, 10.9% of the SC patients received adjuvant therapy. The OS for RC-RL-pN- (5-years OS, 64.4%) was significantly better than for RC-RL-pN+ (5-years OS, 15.7%) or SC (5-years OS, 48.3%) (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Less than 50% of the patients with a T1b GBC primary tumor undergo the recommended surgical treatment. Given that 15% of these patients have nodal metastasis and in light of the previously described benefits of adjuvant therapy for node positive GBC, failure to perform RC-RL risks incomplete staging and thus undertreatment for patients with T1b GBC.

BACKGROUND: There is no consensus on the optimal treatment of T1b gallbladder cancer (GBC) due to the lack of evidence and the difficulty of anatomy and pathological standardization.
METHODS: A total of 272 patients with T1b GBC who underwent surgical resection at 14 centers with specialized hepatobiliary-pancreatic surgeons and pathologists in Korea, Japan, Chile, and the United States were studied. Clinical outcomes including disease-specific survival (DSS) rates according to the types of surgery were analyzed.
RESULTS: After excluding patients, the 237 qualifying patients consisted of 90 men and 147 women. Simple cholecystectomy (SC) was performed in 116 patients (48.9%) and extended cholecystectomy (EC) in 121 patients (51.1%). The overall 5-year DSS was 94.6%, and it was similar between SC and EC patients (93.7% vs. 95.5%, P = 0.496). The 5-year DSS was similar between SC and EC patients in America (82.3% vs. 100.0%, P = 0.249) as well as in Asia (98.6% vs. 95.2%, P = 0.690). The 5-year DSS also did not differ according to lymph node metastasis (P = 0.688) or tumor location (P = 0.474).
CONCLUSIONS: SC showed similar clinical outcomes (including recurrence) and survival outcomes as EC; therefore, EC is not needed for the treatment of T1b GBC.

BACKGROUND Duodenal and ampullary carcinoids are very rare tumors accounting respectively for 2% and 0.03% of all carcinoid tumors. Clinical findings vary according to the location of the tumor within the periampullary region; with epigastric pain being the most common presenting symptom in duodenal carcinoids and jaundice the most common clinical finding in ampullary carcinoids. Treatment options include pancreaticoduodenectomy, local excision, and endoscopic excision. CASE REPORT In this case report, we present a 60-year-old male who presented with a one-week history of intractable epigastric pain. He was diagnosed with duodenal periampullary carcinoid tumor and treated with local excision. CONCLUSIONS Although duodenal and ampullary carcinoid tumors may have different clinical presentations, as well as histochemistry characteristics and metastatic potential, they appear to benefit from the same surgical treatment.

<div class='addthis_inline_share_toolbox' data-url='pbpath.org/journal-watch/' data-title='See this abstract on #PBPath #JournalWatch : Identification of ampullary carcinoma mixed subtype using a panel of six antibodies and its clinical significance PMID: 30548547 '></div>

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the function of immunomarkers CK7, CK20, CK17, CDX2, MUC1, and MUC2 in the identification of primary ampullary carcinoma mixed subtype.
METHODS: Forty-two cases of primary ampullary carcinoma were performed by immunohistochemical studies. The correlation between the mixed subtype and the other two subtypes and patient survival data was analyzed using the SPSS 16.0 statistical software.
RESULTS: Among 42 cases, 12 (28.6%) cases were classified as mixed subtype, which showed variable expression patterns: 91.7% (11/12) for CK7, 83.3% (10/12) for CK20; 66.7% (8/12) for CK17, CDX2, and MUC1; and 50% (6/12) for MUC2. Ten (83.3%) mixed types coexpressed four or more immunomarkers. Eight (19%) intestinal subtypes mainly showed a positive expression of CK20, CDX2, and MUC2. Twenty-two (52.4%) pancreaticobiliary subtypes showed a positive expression of CK7, MUC1, and CK17. Stages III and IV diseases in mixed subtype (25%) and intestinal subtype (25%) were less than pancreaticobiliary subtype(63.6%) (p = 0.039). Follow-up data appeared to show a better survival rate for patients with mixed subtype than those with pancreaticobiliary subtypes.
CONCLUSION: Immunohistochemical staining provided a more reliable means of diagnosing mixed ampulla carcinoma. Accurate subtyping of ampullary carcinoma is clinically important to select effective chemotherapy regimens and to assess disease prognosis.

INTRODUCTION: Ampullary cancer accounts for only 0.2% of GI cancers. The objective of this study was to investigate the incidence, demographics, tumor characteristics, treatment, and survival of patients with ampullary tumors.
METHODS: Data on ampullary cancer between 2004 and 2013 was extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Registry. The clinical epidemiology of these tumors was analyzed using SEER*Stat.
RESULTS: A total of 6803 patients with ampullary cancer were identified. Median age at diagnosis was 71±13 years. The overall age-adjusted incidence of ampullary cancer was 0.59 per 100,000 per year. A higher incidence of ampullary cancer was observed in males compared to females (0.74 vs 0.48 per 100,000 per year). Most tumors were moderately differentiated (39.5%). The most common stage at presentation was Stage I (21%), followed by Stage II (20%). The majority (63%) of these tumors were surgically resected while 20% of patients received radiotherapy. One and 5-year cause-specific survival for ampullary cancer was 71.7% and 38.8% respectively, with a median survival of 31 months. On Cox regression analysis, Black race, increasing cancer stage and grade, N1 stage, and non-surgical treatment were associated with poorer prognosis. Those who were not treated with surgical intervention were at 4.5 times increased risk for death (Hazard Ration 4.5, 95% CI 3.93-5.09, P=0.000).
CONCLUSIONS: The annual incidence of ampullary cancer has been fairly constant, though males are more likely to be affected. While its incidence increases with age, patients who are treated by surgical intervention have significantly better outcomes. Additionally, through the use of endoscopic techniques, ampullary cancer can be detected and treated much earlier.

<div class='addthis_inline_share_toolbox' data-url='pbpath.org/journal-watch/' data-title='See this abstract on #PBPath #JournalWatch : Clinicopathological characteristics of non-functioning cystic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors PMID: 30497875 '></div>

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: The biological features of cystic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs) remain unclear. The aim of this study was to clarify the clinicopathological characteristics of non-functioning PNETs (NF-PNETs) with a cystic component.
METHODS: The medical records of 75 patients with NF-PNETs who had undergone resection in our institution were retrospectively reviewed. Clinicopathological factors were compared between PNETs with and without a cystic component. Expression of somatostatin 2 receptor (SSTR-2) was also analyzed.
RESULTS: Cystic PNETs were diagnosed in 14 patients (19%). The proportion of men was significantly higher for cystic than solid PNETs (79% vs. 44%, P < 0.05) and cystic PNETs were significantly larger than solid PNETs (25 mm vs. 17 mm, P < 0.01). However, there were no significant differences in the prevalence of lymph node metastases (14% vs. 10%, P = 0.64), hepatic metastasis (7% vs. 3%, P = 0.54), or disease-free survival rate (both 86%, P = 0.29) between PNETs with and without a cystic component. SSTR-2 expression was more frequently observed in PNETs with a cystic component than in those without (100% vs. 70%, P < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Although cystic PNETs were larger upon diagnosis than solid PNETs in this study, prognosis after surgical resection did not differ significantly between these types of PNET. Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy and somatostatin analogues may be more useful for diagnosing and treating cystic PNETs, respectively.

<div class='addthis_inline_share_toolbox' data-url='pbpath.org/journal-watch/' data-title='See this abstract on #PBPath #JournalWatch : Prognosis of patients with neuroendocrine tumor: a SEER database analysis PMID: 30519109 '></div>

Background: Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are a group of heterogeneous cancers arising from a variety of anatomic sites. Their incidence has increased in recent years. This study aimed to analyze the prognosis of NETs originating from different anatomic sites.
Methods: We identified 73,782 patients diagnosed with NETs from the Surveillance Epidemiology and Ends Results (SEER) database from 1973 to 2014. Clinical data were compared between patients with different primary tumor sites using the chi-squared test. Differences in survival among NET patients with different tumor sites were compared by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Cox proportional hazard models were performed to identify the prognostic factors of overall survival.
Results: In this cohort, the lung/bronchus was the most common site of NETs, accounting for 30.6%, followed by the small intestine (22.2%), rectum (16.2%), colon (13.4%), pancreas (10.8%), and stomach (6.8%). Totally, 73,782 patients were selected for this cohort from 1973 to 2014. The median survival duration was 41 months. The 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year overall survival rates for patients with NETs were 72.8%, 52.7%, 39.4%, and 18.1%, respectively. Patients with NETs located in the rectum had the best prognosis, followed by those with NETs in the small intestine (HR, 1.660, 95% CI, 1.579, 1.744), lung/bronchus (HR, 1.786, 95% CI, 1.703, 1.874), stomach (HR, 1.865, 95% CI, 1.755, 1.982), and colon (HR, 1.896, 95% CI, 1.799, 1.999). Patients with NETs in the pancreas had the highest risk of mortality (HR, 2.034, 95% CI, 1.925, 2.148).
Conclusion: Significant differences in survival were found among various primary tumor sites. NETs in the rectum had the best prognosis, while those in the pancreas had the worst. Primary tumor sites might be one of the most useful outcome predictors in patients with NETs.

Our group observed the first case of synchronous gastric neuroendocrine tumor (NET) and duodenal gastrinoma with autoimmune chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG), in the absence of Helicobacter pylori infection. Demographic, clinical, endoscopic, and pathologic data were abstracted from the electronic medical record at Mount Sinai Hospital from 2013 to 2015. The patient's anonymity was carefully protected, and informed consent was obtained for publication of protected health information. A 53-year-old woman with hypertension presented to Mount Sinai Hospital in June 2013 for a second opinion for management of gastric and duodenal NETs. After evaluation by gastroenterology and surgery, repeat upper endoscopy with ultrasound and fine-needle aspiration revealed multiple diminutive type I gastric NETs and 2 duodenal NETs, against a background of autoimmune CAG, with biopsy pathology negative for H. pylori. She subsequently underwent a transduodenal resection of the duodenal NETs, confirming low-grade, gastrin-positive, stage T2 duodenal NET. On routine follow-up over the next 2 years, clinical, radiographic, and endoscopic surveillance revealed no recurrent or metastatic gastric or duodenal disease. This first report of synchronous duodenal gastrinoma and gastric NET in the setting of autoimmune CAG can broaden our understanding of gastric NET pathophysiology.

<div class='addthis_inline_share_toolbox' data-url='pbpath.org/journal-watch/' data-title='See this abstract on #PBPath #JournalWatch : Touch imprint cytology on endoscopic ultrasound fine-needle biopsy provides comparable sample quality and diagnostic yield to standard eus-fna specimens in the evaluation of solid pancreatic lesions PMID: 30484917 '></div>

OBJECTIVES: Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) is the gold standard for the diagnosis of solid pancreatic lesions (SPLs). Cytological samples can also be obtained using touch imprint cytology (TIC) on EUS fine-needle biopsy (FNB) specimens. We aimed to compare sample quality and diagnostic yield of EUS-FNA-standard cytology (EUS-FNA-SC) to that of EUS-FNB-TIC in a series of patients with SPLs.
METHODS: Thirty-two consecutive patients referred for EUS-tissue acquisition of SPLs who underwent rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) of both EUS-FNA-SC and paired EUS-FNB-TIC during the same endoscopic session were retrospectively identified. Sample quality (evaluated in terms of blood contamination, presence of clots, tissue casts, cellularity, and necrosis) and diagnostic yield were compared between the techniques.
RESULTS: The mean number of passes to reach diagnosis at ROSE was similar between EUS-FNA-SC and EUS-FNB-TIC (1.09 ± 0.3 vs 1.13 ± 0.34, P = .711). EUS-FNA-SC scores of sample quality were comparable to those of EUS-FNB-TIC (blood contamination, 2.47 ± 1.11 vs 2.25 ± 1.14, P = .109; clots, 1.25 ± 0.76 vs 1.19 ± 0.69, P = .624; tissue casts, 3.56 ± 0.88 vs 3.59 ± 1.09, P = .872; cellularity, 2.84 ± 1.11 vs 3.09 ± 1.09, P = .244; necrosis, 2.25 ± 1.08 vs 2.53 ± 1.02 P = .059; total score, 12.38 ± 2.88 vs 17.66 ± 2.38, P = .536). Adequacy, sensitivity and diagnostic accuracy of the two sampling techniques were equal (93.7%, 90.6%, 90.6%, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: EUS-FNB-TIC provides comparable samples to those of EUS-FNA-SC and combines the benefits of cytology and histology for the evaluation of SPLs by employing a single needle during the same endoscopic procedure. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

<div class='addthis_inline_share_toolbox' data-url='pbpath.org/journal-watch/' data-title='See this abstract on #PBPath #JournalWatch : Diagnostic Value of S100p, IMP3, Maspin, and pVHL in the Differantial Diagnosis of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma and Normal/chronic Pancreatitis in Fine Needle Aspiration Biopsy PMID: 30498299 '></div>

Introduction: Differentiation between pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) from benign mimickers is a well-known problem in cytological materials. Recent studies incorporated biological markers into this question and some studies showed that expression of S100P, IMP3, and maspin as well as nonexpression of von Hippel-Lindau gene product (pVHL) were significantly correlated with PDAC. In this study, we aimed to investigate diagnostic value of maspin, IMP3, S100P, and pVHL immunostaining in fine needle aspiration biopsies (FNABs) of pancreatic lesions.
Materials and Method: In all, 33 cases of FNAB cell blocks of PDAC and 34 cases of surgical non-neoplastic pancreas specimens which were retrieved from the archives slides from 2007 to 2011 were included in this study. All the cases were stained with maspin, IMP3, S100P, and pVHL. Expression patterns of markers were scored and compared with benign mimickers. Test performance of each antibody and possible antibody combinations were also evaluated.
Results: The study was composed of 33 PDAC and 34 control cases (8 chronic pancreatitis, 3 mucinous cystic neoplasm, and 23 nontumoral pancreatic tissue of PDAC). Diagnostic sensitivity for malignancy in S100P, IMP3, and maspin was 84.8%, 81.8%, and 87.5%, respectively. Specificity of these three markers was 100%. Sensitivity and specificity of pVHL for detecting nontumoral pancreatic tissue were 100% and 81.8%, respectively. When maspin, IMP3, and S100P expression were used together as triple test, sensitivity was 62.5% and specificity 100%. However, when any two of each three markers were evaluated (triple test/dual response), sensitivity reached 93.8% and specificity 100%.
Conclusion: We observed that dual response in triple test (positive staining with two of these three markers) of maspin, IMP3, and S100P immunocytochemistry is very sensitive and specific in differential diagnosis of PDA and non-neoplastic pancreatic lesions. pVHL may have an additional role, when triple assessment is not satisfactory.

<div class='addthis_inline_share_toolbox' data-url='pbpath.org/journal-watch/' data-title='See this abstract on #PBPath #JournalWatch : Feasibility and safety of microforceps biopsy in the diagnosis of pancreatic cysts PMID: 29510146 '></div>

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The tissue acquisition and diagnostic yield of cyst fluid cytology is low-to-moderate and rarely provides a specific diagnosis. The aim of this study was to compare the tissue acquisition and diagnostic tissue yield of microforceps biopsy (MFB) with cyst fluid cytology.
METHODS: In this multicenter study, data of 42 patients who had cysts both aspirated by EUS-guided FNA (EUS-FNA) and biopsy specimens were then obtained with an MFB device, were collected. Cytology analysis of cyst fluid and histologic analysis of biopsy specimens were done. Acquisition yield was defined as percentage of patients with tissue present in the aspirate or biopsy. Diagnostic tissue yield was evaluated at 3 levels: the ability of differentiation between mucinous and/or nonmucinous cysts, detection of high risk for malignancy, and specific cyst type diagnosis.
RESULTS: The mean patient age was 69 years. Sixteen pancreatic cysts (38.1%) were located in the head, 17 (40.5%) in the body, and 9 (21.4%) in the tail. The mean cyst size was 28.2 mm (12-60 mm); 25 of 42 (60%) were septated. The EUS-FNA tissue (fluid) acquisition yield was 88.1% (37/42). The MFB tissue acquisition yield was 90.4% (38/42). The diagnostic cytology yield to differentiate between mucinous and/or nonmucinous cysts was 47.6% (20/42), and the MFB histologic yield to differentiate between mucinous and/or nonmucinous cysts was 61.9% (26/42) (P = .188). The percentage of cysts at high risk for malignancy by cytology was 54.7% (23/42), and MFB was 71.5% (30/42) (P = .113). However, the ability of MFB to provide a specific cyst type diagnosis was 35.7% (15/42), and that for cytology was 4.8% (2/42) (P = .001). Surgical histology was concordant with that of MFB in 6 of 7 patients (85%), and with that of cytology in 1 of 7 patients (15%).
CONCLUSION: The cyst tissue acquisition yield for MFBs was 90%. Although cytology of cyst fluid and MFB were comparable in distinguishing mucinous and nonmucinous cysts and detecting cysts at high risk for malignancy, MFB was far superior to cytology for providing a specific cyst diagnosis.

Solid pseudopapillary neoplasm of the pancreas (SPN) is a rare low-grade malignancy typically occurring in young women. Occasionally, these neoplasms present with pleomorphic to atypical multinucleated giant tumor cells which may mimic high-grade malignancy. Our patient is a 25-year-old male who presented with one year of intermittent epigastric pain. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a 3.1 × 2.5 cm mass in the pancreas body. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration of the mass showed large pleomorphic cells and atypical multinucleated giant cells in a background of singly scattered polygonal cells. Focally, these cells surrounded delicate hyalinized to fibrovascular cores forming pseudopapillae. Immunohistochemical stains show tumor cells are positive for beta-catenin, CD10, vimentin, and CD56. Although rare surgical pathology publications have described the presence of pleomorphic to atypical multinucleated giant cells occurring in SPN, to our knowledge, this is the first case reported example focused on cytomorphologic illustration and description.

Two-thirds of neuroendocrine neoplasms arising in the human body originate from the gastrointestinal system or pancreas. Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms are heterogeneous, comprising both well differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) and poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs). The clinical presentation, molecular characteristics, and behavior are distinct for NETs and NECs. Fine-needle aspiration is an important modality for the primary diagnosis and staging of these neoplasms and can provide information of prognostic and therapeutic significance. Our evolving understanding of neuroendocrine neoplasm biology has led to several iterations of classification. In this review, new concepts and issues most relevant to cytology diagnosis of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms are discussed, such as newer detection methods that aid in diagnosis and staging, recent changes in World Health Organization classification, practical issues related to grading these neoplasms on cytology, guidelines for diagnostic reporting, and panels of immunohistochemical stains for the diagnosis of metastasis. The current understanding of genetic and epigenetic events related to tumor development and potential applications for cytology also are presented as they relate to prognostication and recent therapeutic advances.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains a challenging disease that is mostly diagnosed late in the course of the illness. Unlike other cancers in which measurable successes have been achieved with traditional chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and, recently, immunotherapy, PDAC has proved to be poorly responsive to these treatments, with only marginal to modest incremental benefits using conventional cytotoxic therapy. There is, therefore, a great unmet need to develop better therapies based on improved understanding of biology and identification of predictive and prognostic biomarkers that would guide therapy. miRNAs are small noncoding RNAs that regulate the expression of some key genes by targeting their 3'-untranslated mRNA region. Aberrant expression of miRNAs has been linked to the development of various malignancies, including PDAC. A series of miRNAs have been identified as potential tools for early diagnosis, prediction of treatment response, and prognosis of patients with PDAC. In this review, we present a summary of the miRNAs that have been studied in PDAC in the context of disease biology.

The pancreas originates from two epithelial evaginations of the foregut, which consist of multipotent epithelial progenitors that organize into a complex tubular epithelial network. The trunk domain of each epithelial branch consists of bipotent pancreatic progenitors (bi-PPs) that give rise to both duct and endocrine lineages, whereas the tips give rise to acinar cells1. Here we identify the extrinsic and intrinsic signalling mechanisms that coordinate the fate-determining transcriptional events underlying these lineage decisions1,2. Single-cell analysis of pancreatic bipotent pancreatic progenitors derived from human embryonic stem cells reveal that cell confinement is a prerequisite for endocrine specification, whereas spreading drives the progenitors towards a ductal fate. Mechanistic studies identify the interaction of extracellular matrix (ECM) with integrin α5 as the extracellular cue that cell-autonomously, via the F-actin-YAP1-Notch mechanosignalling axis, controls the fate of bipotent pancreatic progenitors. Whereas ECM-integrin α5 signalling promotes differentiation towards the duct lineage, endocrinogenesis is stimulated when this signalling cascade is disrupted. This cascade can be disrupted pharmacologically or genetically to convert bipotent pancreatic progenitors derived from human embryonic stem cells to hormone-producing islet cells. Our findings identify the cell-extrinsic and intrinsic mechanotransduction pathway that acts as gatekeeper in the fate decisions of bipotent pancreatic progenitors in the developing pancreas.

Arsenic trioxide is an approved chemotheraputic agent for the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Recently, numerous studies suggested that arsenic trioxide acts as anti-cancer roles in various human malignancies. However, the molecular mechanisms are not fully elucidated. In this study, we explored the critical targets of arsenic trioxide and their interaction network systematically by searching the publicly available published database like DrugBank (DB) and STRING. Seven direct protein targets (DPTs) and 111 DPT-associated genes were identified. The enrichment analysis of arsenic trioxide associated genes/proteins revealed 10 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways. Among these pathways, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate-3-kinase -Akt (PI3K-Akt) single pathway and pancreatic cancer pathway are highly correlated with arsenic trioxide and have 5 overlapped targets. Then we investigated the gene alternation of selected critical genes in pancreatic cancer studies using cBio portal. These results indicated that arsenic trioxide could act anti-tumor function through PI3K-Akt single pathway and identified critical genes might be therapeutic targets for pancreatic cancer.

<div class='addthis_inline_share_toolbox' data-url='pbpath.org/journal-watch/' data-title='See this abstract on #PBPath #JournalWatch : Is mitochondrial DNA copy number a good prognostic marker in resectable pancreatic cancer? PMID: 30528645 '></div>

BACKGROUND: The aim of this prospective study was to investigate mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number in a group of resectable pancreatic cancer (PC) tumor tissues and adjacent normal pancreatic tissues, and to explore the correlation between the mtDNA content in tissues and the clinicopathological parameters and the overall survival.
METHODS: Relative mtDNA copy number was measured by the quantitative PCR-based assay. The tumors specimens (n = 43) originated from the patients with pathologically confirmed pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma who did not receive any neoadjuvant systemic therapy. The adjacent normal pancreatic tissue samples (n = 31) were obtained from surgical margins.
RESULTS: mtDNA copy number was significantly lower in PC tissue (P < 0.001) compared to adjacent normal pancreatic tissue. Jonckheere-Terpstra trend testing indicated a statistically significant decrease in median mtDNA copy number across the differentiation (adjacent normal pancreatic tissue, low-grade, intermediate-grade, high-grade cancer), P < 0.001. However, the survival analyses failed to show a significant difference in survival between patients with high and low mtDNA copy number.
CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, we provided the first evidence that mitochondrial DNA copy number was significantly lower in pancreatic cancer tissue (P < 0.001) compared to adjacent normal pancreatic tissue. Also, we demonstrated that mitochondrial copy number was not a significant marker for predicting prognosis in resectable pancreatic cancer.

<div class='addthis_inline_share_toolbox' data-url='pbpath.org/journal-watch/' data-title='See this abstract on #PBPath #JournalWatch : Cell‑to‑cell communication via extracellular vesicles among human pancreatic cancer cells derived from the same patient PMID: 30106154 '></div>

Despite existing multimodal therapies, pancreatic cancer exhibits high metastatic capability and poor prognosis. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nanoparticles comprising lipid bilayers and various other components, such as protein and nucleic acids, derived from secreted cells. Recent research has demonstrated the involvement of EVs released from cancer cells in the metastasis of cancer cells to distant organs. However, the effects of EVs released from pancreatic cancer cells on other pancreatic cancer cells in a tumor microenvironment remain unclear. The present study aimed to elucidate that EVs released from PK‑45H pancreatic cancer cells are taken up by PK‑45P pancreatic cancer cells derived from the same patient through dynamin‑related endocytosis. Additionally, EVs released from PK‑45H cells augment the phosphorylation of classical mitogen‑activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways in PK‑45P cells. The uptake of EVs released from PK‑45H cells by PK‑45P cells stimulates cell migration through the classical MAPK‑dependent pathway, suggesting that EVs released from one pancreatic cancer cell are taken up by other surrounding pancreatic cancer cells and could be critical inducers of cancer metastasis in the tumor microenvironment.

<div class='addthis_inline_share_toolbox' data-url='pbpath.org/journal-watch/' data-title='See this abstract on #PBPath #JournalWatch : Coordinately targeting cell cycle checkpoint functions in integrated models of pancreatic cancer PMID: 30538111 '></div>

PURPOSE: Cancer cells often have deficiencies in cell cycle control mechanisms and could be dependent on specific cell cycle checkpoints to maintain viability. Due to the documented role of KRAS in driving replication stress, we targeted the checkpoint governing DNA replication using CHK1 kinase inhibitors in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) models and examined mechanisms of resistance.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Single agent efficacy of CHK1 inhibition was investigated in established and primary PDAC lines. Drug screening was performed to identify cooperative agents. In vitro and in vivo studies were employed to interrogate combination treatment efficacy and mechanisms of resistance.
RESULTS: Many PDAC models evade single agent inhibition through mechanisms that allow S-phase progression with CHK1 inhibited. Gene expression analysis revealed FOXM1 as a potential marker of CHK1 sensitivity and defined a form of pancreatic cancer with poor prognosis. Drug screen analysis identified WEE1 as a cooperative agent with CHK1 and was effective in cell culture. In vivo experiments validated the combination efficacy; however, resistance could evolve. Resistance was due to selection of a stable sub-clone from the original PDX tumor, which harbored high baseline replication stress. In vitro analysis revealed that gemcitabine could eliminate viability in the resistant models. The triplet regimen of gemcitabine, CHK1 and WEE1 inhibition provided strong disease control in all xenograft models interrogated.
CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate the therapeutic resiliency of pancreatic cancer and indicate that coordinately targeting cell cycle checkpoints in concert with chemotherapy could be particularly efficacious.

<div class='addthis_inline_share_toolbox' data-url='pbpath.org/journal-watch/' data-title='See this abstract on #PBPath #JournalWatch : IQGAP1 Maintains Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Clonogenic Growth and Metastasis PMID: 30540680 '></div>

OBJECTIVES: IQ motif containing GTPase-activating protein 1 (IQGAP1) acts as a scaffold for aberrant mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling driven by KRAS mutations in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). We determined the role of IQGAP1 in clonogenic growth and metastasis in PDAC.
METHODS: We inhibited IQGAP1 expression using shRNA and assessed clonogenic growth, cell migration, and MAPK signaling in vitro and tumor initiation and metastasis in vivo. The efficacy of a peptide mimicking the IQGAP1 WW domain that binds and inhibits ERK1/2 was determined in vitro and in vivo.
RESULTS: IQGAP1 loss inhibited clonogenic growth and migration of KRAS-dependent PDAC cells by disrupting MAPK signaling. In mice, IQGAP1 knockdown decreased tumor-initiating cell frequency and metastasis. WW peptide treatment inhibited clonogenic growth and in vivo tumor growth.
CONCLUSIONS: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma clonogenic growth, metastasis, and tumor initiation are dependent on MAPK signaling via IQGAP1. Treatment with a WW peptide disrupts IQGAP1 function and represents a novel targeting strategy for PDAC.

Sonic hedgehog (SHH) is a secreted protein which functions in autocrine or paracrine fashion on target cells to activate hedgehog (HH) signalling cascade responsible for growth and proliferation. This study is an attempt to understand the expression dynamics of SHH protein in colon, rectal and pancreatic cancers. Protein expression of SHH was studied by Western Blotting in the histologically confirmed colon, rectum and pancreatic cancer tissue samples along with their adjacent normal tissues. Only 31.4% (11 of 35) and 26.9% (7 of 26) of colon and rectal cancer cases respectively showed an increase in SHH expression in tumours compared to 72.7% (24 of 33) of the pancreatic cancer cases when compared with their adjacent normal tissues. Our results suggest that SHH may have a strong role in the predisposition of Pancreatic cancer and could possibly be used as a diagnostic or prognostic biomarker.

<div class='addthis_inline_share_toolbox' data-url='pbpath.org/journal-watch/' data-title='See this abstract on #PBPath #JournalWatch : Higher notch expression implies poor survival in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma: A systematic review and meta-analysis PMID: 30297095 '></div>

BACKGROUND: At present, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a fetal disease lack of effective prognostic and therapeutic methods resulting in high mortality. The Notch signaling has been demonstrated being up- or down-regulated in many cancers, but the effects in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma are still controversial. Moreover, the available cases in an individual study are of small samples. Therefore, it is essential to define the effect of Notch signaling in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma with larger samples.
METHODS: Conducted from 6 eligible studies and 463 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma patients, this was the first meta-analysis to analyze the correlation between the Notch signal pathway and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. All data were sourced from The National Center for Biotechnology Information, Web of Science and Cochrane. The articles which matched the inclusion criteria were included. All included data were analyzed and performed by Review Manager 5.3.
RESULTS: The results indicated that high expression of Notch signaling proteins was associated with poor overall survival of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma patients (pooled hazard ratio>2.00; P < 0.001). Moreover, poor survival was related to high expression of Notch3 (pooled hazard ratio: 2.05; confidence interval: 1.49-2.82; P < 0.001) and DLL4 (pooled hazard ratio: 2.13; confidence interval: 1.37-3.32; P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis supports that Notch signaling proteins may be available as prognostic factors for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma progression and patient survival. Higher expression of Notch signaling proteins indicated poor survival of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma patients. Targeting Notch signaling components, especially Notch3 protein, would be beneficial for therapies.

Pancreatic cancer is detected late in the disease process and has an extremely poor prognosis. A blood-based biomarker that can enable early detection of disease, monitor response to treatment, and potentially allow for personalized treatment would be of great benefit. This review analyzes the literature regarding two potential biomarkers, circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and cell-free DNA (cfDNA), with regard to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. The origin of CTCs and the methods of detection are discussed and a decade of research examining CTCs in pancreatic cancer is summarized, including both levels of CTCs and analyzing their molecular characteristics and how they may affect survival in both advanced and early disease and allow for treatment monitoring. The origin of cfDNA is discussed, and the literature over the past 15 years is summarized. This includes analyzing cfDNA for genetic mutations and methylation abnormalities, which have the potential to be used for the detection and prognosis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. However, the research certainly remains in the experimental stage, warranting future large trials in these areas.

The last 5 years have seen a dramatic increased interest in the field of exosome biology. Although much is unknown about the role of exosomes in human health and disease, disparate scientific disciplines are recognizing the highly conserved role that exosomes play in fundamental biological processes. Recently, there have been intriguing discoveries defining the role of exosomes in cancer biology. We performed a structured review of the English-language literature using the PubMed database searching for articles relating to exosomes and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Articles were screened for relevance and content to judge for inclusion. Evidence implicates exosomes in the pathogenesis, local progression, metastasis, immune evasion, and intercellular communication of PDAC. Basic science discoveries in exosome biology have the potential to change the clinical management of PDAC, where, despite advances in early detection, diagnosis, staging, chemotherapy, and surgery, survival rates have been stagnant for decades and PDAC remains the most deadly human gastrointestinal malignancy.

- **MiR-1-5p is down-regulated in gallbladder carcinoma and suppresses cell proliferation, migration and invasion by targeting Notch2**
</summary>

<div class='addthis_inline_share_toolbox' data-url='pbpath.org/journal-watch/' data-title='See this abstract on #PBPath #JournalWatch : MiR-1-5p is down-regulated in gallbladder carcinoma and suppresses cell proliferation, migration and invasion by targeting Notch2 PMID: 30497876 '></div>

BACKGROUND: Numerous studies have demonstrated that aberrant microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in tumorigenesis and tumor progression. Nevertheless, the precise role of miR-1-5p in gallbladder carcinoma cell growth and metastasis remains not fully revealed.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The levels of miR-1-5p were detected in gallbladder carcinoma tissues and cell lines using qRT-PCR method. A series of functional assays, including cell proliferation, colony formation, wound healing and Transwell invasion were conducted using miR-1-5p or miR-1-5p inhibitor transfected cells.
RESULTS: MiR-1-5p was remarkably down-regulated in gallbladder carcinoma tissues and cell lines compared to normal. In addition, over-expression of miR-1-5p markedly suppressed the growth, migration and invasion of gallbladder carcinoma cell. Conversely, down-expression of miR-1-5p facilitated gallbladder carcinoma cell proliferation and aggressiveness. Mechanistic investigations demonstrated that neurogenic locus notch homolog protein 2 (Notch2) was the directly target of miR-1-5p and Notch2 mediated the inhibitory effect of miR-1-5p in gallbladder carcinoma cell growth and aggressiveness.
CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrated that miR-1-5p acted as a suppressive miRNA and played vital roles in the growth, migration and invasion of gallbladder carcinoma cell through targeting Notch2.

*Oncology reports 2018 Dec;40(6):3501-3510*

<div class='addthis_inline_share_toolbox' data-url='pbpath.org/journal-watch/' data-title='See this abstract on #PBPath #JournalWatch : Metformin suppresses hypoxia‑induced migration via the HIF‑1α/VEGF pathway in gallbladder cancer in vitro and in vivo PMID: 30272364 '></div>

Hypoxia plays a crucial role in cancer development and progression. Overexpression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF‑1α) has been demonstrated in a hypoxic microenvironment in various tumor types. Metformin has been identified as an antitumor drug in various tumor types. However, its role in cellular migration in a hypoxic microenvironment, and the associated regulatory mechanism, have yet to be fully elucidated. The present study aimed to investigate the clinical significance of HIF‑1α, and its biological role, in gallbladder cancer (GBC). Furthermore, the role of metformin in cellular migration, and its underlying mechanism in GBC, were also identified. Real‑time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis and immunohistochemistry experiments revealed that HIF‑1α was significantly upregulated in GBC tissues. HIF‑1α overexpression was closely associated with lymph node metastasis and tumor‑lymph node‑metastasis (TNM) stages. HIF‑1α was able to promote cell migration in a hypoxic microenvironment by overexpressing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in GBC‑SD cells, an effect which was partly reversed by small‑interfering RNA HIF‑1α (siHIF‑1α) and 2‑methoxyestradiol. Further experiments demonstrated that metformin inhibited hypoxia‑induced migration via HIF‑1α/VEGF in vitro. In addition, metformin suppressed GBC growth and downregulated the expression of HIF‑1α and VEGF in a GBC‑SD cell xenograft model. Taken together, these results suggest that HIF‑1α may contribute to tumor migration via the overexpression of VEGF in GBC, while metformin is able to inhibit tumor migration by targeting the HIF‑1α/VEGF pathway.

Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors are rare tumors of the pancreas originating from the islets of the Langerhans. These tumors comprise 1% to 3% of all newly diagnosed pancreatic cancers every year and have a unique heterogeneity in clinical presentation. Whole-genome sequencing has led to an increased understanding of the molecular biology of these tumors. In this review, we will summarize the current knowledge of the signaling pathways involved in the tumorigenesis of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors as well as the major studies targeting these pathways at preclinical and clinical levels.

- **Circulating interleukin-6 is associated with disease progression, but not cachexia in pancreatic cancer**
</summary> 

*Pancreatology : official journal of the International Association of Pancreatology (IAP) ... [et al.] 2018 Nov;():*

PubMed: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=30497874

<div class='addthis_inline_share_toolbox' data-url='pbpath.org/journal-watch/' data-title='See this abstract on #PBPath #JournalWatch : Circulating interleukin-6 is associated with disease progression, but not cachexia in pancreatic cancer PMID: 30497874 '></div>

BACKGROUND: Cachexia is a wasting syndrome characterized by involuntary loss of >5% body weight due to depletion of adipose and skeletal muscle mass. In cancer, the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) is considered a mediator of cachexia and a potential biomarker, but the relationship between IL-6, weight loss, and cancer stage is unknown. In this study we sought to evaluate IL-6 as a biomarker of cancer cachexia while accounting for disease progression.
METHODS: We retrospectively studied 136 subjects with biopsy-proven pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), considering the high prevalence of cachexia is this population. Clinical data were abstracted from subjects in all cancer stages, and plasma IL-6 levels were measured using a multiplex array and a more sensitive ELISA. Data were evaluated with univariate comparisons, including Kaplan-Meier survival curves, and multivariate Cox survival models.
RESULTS: On multiplex, a total of 43 (31.4%) subjects had detectable levels of plasma IL-6, while by ELISA all subjects had detectable IL-6 levels. We found that increased plasma IL-6 levels, defined as detectable for multiplex and greater than median for ELISA, were not associated with weight loss at diagnosis, but rather with the presence of metastasis (p < 0.001 for multiplex and p = 0.007 for ELISA). Further, while >5% weight loss was not associated with worse survival, increased plasma IL-6 by either methodology was.
CONCLUSION: Circulating IL-6 levels do not correlate with cachexia (when defined by weight loss), but rather with advanced cancer stage. This suggests that IL-6 may mediate wasting, but should not be considered a diagnostic biomarker for PDAC-induced cachexia.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), although a rare disease, has a poor prognosis. With 5-year overall survival of 8%, there is a critical need to detect PDAC early or at a premalignant stage. Current screening methods are largely imaging based, but a more focused screening approach based on modifiable and nonmodifiable risk factors may improve the efficacy and likely outcomes of screening. In addition, the pathologic mechanisms that lead to the development of PDAC are discussed in an effort to further understand the targets of pancreatic cancer screening. The focus of this article will be inherited pancreatic cancer syndromes and familial pancreatic cancer, which together compose up to 10% of PDAC. Understanding the methods and targets of PDAC screening in high-risk individuals may translate to improved morbidity and mortality.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has a 5-year survival rate of only 8% and is estimated to be the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths by 2021. Prior convention held that screening for PDAC would not be beneficial; however, a deeper understanding of the carcinogenesis pathway supports a potential window of opportunity among the target population. Screening for PDAC is not a standard practice among the general population because of its low incidence. However, screening may be beneficial for individuals with familial history, chronic diseases with genetic predispositions, or inherited cancer syndromes, such as hereditary breast ovarian cancer syndrome, hereditary pancreatitis, Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, familial atypical multiple mole melanoma, Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer), ataxia telangiectasia, and Li-Fraumeni syndrome, all of which have been associated with an increased risk of developing PDAC. The screening strategies among these high-risk individuals are targeted to identify precursor lesions and PDAC at an early resectable stage. This review describes the risk factors for pancreatic cancer, especially the genetic risk factors in high-risk individuals and current screening strategies available for PDAC.

OBJECTIVES: High dietary fiber may protect against pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). We investigated associations between fiber intake and the risk of PDAC using for the first time 7-day food diaries.
METHODS: Participants in the European Prospective Investigation Into Cancer-Norfolk completed the 7-day food diaries at recruitment. The cohort was followed up for 17 years to identify those who developed PDAC. Participants were divided into quintiles of fiber intake, and hazard ratios (HR) were estimated with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Fiber was tested for effect modification of high red and processed meat intake and smoking and the risk of PDAC.
RESULTS: No significant associations for any quintiles of intake (HR Q5 vs Q1, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.56-2.08) were detected with no trend across quintiles. A high-fiber diet modified positive associations between red and processed meats with the development of PDAC (HR trends, 0.89 [95% CI, 0.47-1.69] and 1.02 [95% CI, 0.55-1.88], respectively) but not those with lower fiber intake. Fiber intake did not modify the risk of PDAC in past and current smokers.
CONCLUSION: The findings do not suggest that fiber protects against PDAC, although it may decrease potential deleterious effects of meats.

<div class='addthis_inline_share_toolbox' data-url='pbpath.org/journal-watch/' data-title='See this abstract on #PBPath #JournalWatch : Nomogram to Predict Cancer-Specific Survival in Patients with Pancreatic Acinar Cell Carcinoma: A Competing Risk Analysis PMID: 30519311 '></div>

Background: The objective of this study was to evaluate the probability of cancer-specific death of patients with acinar cell carcinoma (ACC) and build nomograms to predict overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) of these patients. Methods: Data were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Patients diagnosed with ACC between 2004 and 2014 were retrospectively collected. Cancer-specific mortality and competing risk mortality were evaluated. Nomograms for estimating 1-, 2- and 3-year OS and CSS were established based on Cox regression model and Fine and Grey's model. The precision of the 1-, 2- and 3-year survival of the nomograms was evaluated and compared using the area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). Results: The study cohort included 227 patients with ACC. The established nomograms were well calibrated, and had good discriminative ability, with a concordance index (C-index) of 0.742 for OS prediction and 0.766 for CSS prediction. The nomograms displayed better discrimination power than 7th or 8th edition Tumor-Node-Metastasis (TNM) stage systems in training set and validation set for predicting both OS and CSS. The AUC values of the nomogram predicting 1-, 2-, and 3-year OS rates were 0.784, 0.797 and 0.805, respectively, which were higher than those of 7th or 8th edition TNM stage systems. Regard to the prediction of CSS rates, the AUC values of the nomogram were also higher than those of 7th or 8th edition TNM stage systems. Conclusion: We evaluated the 1-, 2- and 3-year OS and CSS in patients with ACC for the first time. Our nomograms showed relatively good performance and could be considered as convenient individualized predictive tools for prognosis.

<div class='addthis_inline_share_toolbox' data-url='pbpath.org/journal-watch/' data-title='See this abstract on #PBPath #JournalWatch : Systematic review and meta-analysis: Prevalence of incidentally detected pancreatic cystic lesions in asymptomatic individuals PMID: 30503370 '></div>

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Pancreatic cystic lesions (PCLs) are frequent incidental findings. As most PCLs require costly diagnostic evaluation and active surveillance, it is important to clarify their prevalence in asymptomatic individuals. We therefore aimed at performing a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine it.
METHODS: a systematic search was conducted and studies meeting inclusion criteria were included. The prevalence of PCLs was pooled across studies. A random effect model was used with assessment of heterogeneity.
RESULTS: 17 studies, with 48,860 patients, were included. Only 3 were prospective; 5 studies were conducted in the US, 7 in Europe, 4 in Asia and 1 in Brazil. The pooled prevalence of PCLs was 8% (95% CI 4-14) with considerable heterogeneity (I2 = 99.5%). This prevalence was higher in studies of higher quality, examining older subjects, smaller cohorts, and employing MRCP (24.8% vs 2.7% with CT-scan). The pooled rate of PCLs was four times higher in studies conducted in the US than in Asia (12.6% vs 3.1%). 7 studies reported the prevalence of mucinous lesions, with a pooled rate of 4.3% (95% CI 2-10; I2 = 99.2%), but of 0.7% only for worrisome features or high risk stigmata.
CONCLUSION: The rate of incidentally detected PCLs is of 8%. Mucinous lesions are the most common incidentally detected PCLs, although they rarely present with potential indication for surgery. The observed different rates in the US and other geographic Areas suggest that different protocols might be necessary to help balancing costs and effectiveness of follow-up investigations in asymptomatic subjects.

</summary> 

*Pancreatology : official journal of the International Association of Pancreatology (IAP) ... [et al.] 2018 Nov;():*

<div class='addthis_inline_share_toolbox' data-url='pbpath.org/journal-watch/' data-title='See this abstract on #PBPath #JournalWatch : Tumor growth rate of pancreatic serous cystadenomas: Endosonographic follow-up with volume measurement to predict cyst enlargement PMID: 30503637 '></div>

BACKGROUND: Serous cystadenomas are benign lesions of the pancreas. Usually they are diagnosed incidentally on cross-sectional imaging studies. Endosonography is a valuable tool in the diagnosis and follow-up of these cystic lesions. Given its benign nature, surgical resection is advised only in symptomatic patients. The interval and length of surveillance is not well established.
METHODS: A retrospective single center study was done. All the patients with a pancreatic serous cystadenoma sent for an endosonographic evaluation, between December 2008 and December 2015 were included. The lesions were follow-up endosonographically at least once, in a 12 months interval. Volume was measured with the formula π/6 × (d1 x d1 x d2). Two groups were evaluated: patients with a volume under 10 mL (Group 1) and those with a volume of 10 mL or more at presentation (Group 2). Growth rate between these two groups was compared.
RESULTS: Thirty-one patients were analyzed, with a mean age of 58.2 years. Patients were mainly women (87%). Twenty-four patients in Group 1 had a mean enlargement of 0.67 ml per year, whereas patients in Group 2 had a mean enlargement of 9.8 ml per year. The growth rate difference between these two groups was statistically significant (p = 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: Asymptomatic patients with pancreatic serous cystadenomas should be follow-up for enlargement. Small volume lesions have a low risk of enlargement compared with high volume and macrocystic serous cystadenomas. Volume at presentation is a feature to analyze when defining surveillance interval.

<div class='addthis_inline_share_toolbox' data-url='pbpath.org/journal-watch/' data-title='See this abstract on #PBPath #JournalWatch : Results of First-round of Surveillance in Individuals at High-risk of Pancreatic Cancer from the AISP (Italian Association for the Study of the Pancreas) Registry PMID: 30538291 '></div>

INTRODUCTION: Surveillance programs on high-risk individuals (HRIs) can detect pre-malignant lesions or early pancreatic cancer (PC). We report the results of the first screening round of the Italian multicenter program supported by the Italian Association for the study of the Pancreas (AISP).
METHODS: The multicenter surveillance program included asymptomatic HRIs with familial (FPC) or genetic frailty (GS: BRCA1/2, p16/CDKN2A, STK11/LKB1or PRSS1, mutated genes) predisposition to PC. The surveillance program included at least an annual magnetic resonance cholangio pancreatography (MRCP). Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) was proposed to patients who refused or could not be submitted to MRCP.
RESULTS: One-hundreds eighty-seven HRIs underwent a first-round screening examination with MRCP (174; 93.1%) or EUS (13; 6.9%) from September 2015 to March 2018.The mean age was 51 years (range 21-80).One-hundreds sixty-five (88.2%) FPC and 22 (11.8%) GF HRIs were included. MRCP detected 28 (14.9%) presumed branch-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN), 1 invasive carcinoma/IPMN and one low-grade mixed-type IPMN, respectively. EUS detected 4 PC (2.1%): 1 was resected, 1 was found locally advanced intraoperatively, and 2 were metastatic. Age > 50 (OR 3.3, 95%CI 1.4-8), smoking habit (OR 2.8, 95%CI 1.1-7.5), and having > 2 relatives with PC (OR 2.7, 95%CI 1.1-6.4) were independently associated with detection of pre-malignant and malignant lesions. The diagnostic yield for MRCP/EUS was 24% for cystic lesions. The overall rate of surgery was 2.6% with nil mortality.
DISCUSSION: The rate of malignancies found in this cohort was high (2.6%). According to the International Cancer of the Pancreas Screening Consortium the screening goal achievement was high (1%).
